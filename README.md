# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-Uipath

# Hackathon RPA Project 🚀  

##Overview  
This repository contains an UiPath RPA (Robotic Process Automation) workflow, designed to automate a specific process efficiently. The project is built using UiPath Studio and includes various activities, data handling, and integrations to streamline automation. 

##Objective
The goal of this project is to eliminate manual work in a specific domain by using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to handle tasks like data entry, document processing, email automation, and UI interactions.


Key Features  
✅ Automated workflow built with UiPath  
✅ Uses UiPath ML Services for intelligent automation  
✅ Supports data processing with System.Data and Collections  
✅ Modular and scalable design  
✅ Handles **error logging** and **exception handling**  
✅ **Cross-platform compatibility** via Orchestrator  

Technical Implementation
📌 Technology Stack
UiPath Studio – Workflow development
UiPath ML Services – Machine learning models integration
UiPath Orchestrator – Workflow scheduling and monitoring

🏗 Project Workflow
Data Extraction: The bot collects data from emails, Excel files, databases, or web pages.
Processing & Decision-Making: Uses ML models and business rules to validate and process data.
Automation & Actions:
Enters data into applications (ERP, CRM, or websites)
Sends emails and generates reports
Performs file operations (moving, renaming, archiving)
Logging & Error Handling:
Generates logs for debugging and audit purposes
Uses Try-Catch blocks for exception handling
